## Summary <a name="summary"></a>
This is a demo of a contact center ACD application implemented with Redis.  Multiple skills and multi-skilled agents are supported.  Longest Available Agent (LAA) targeting is performed.

## Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>
### Redis Data Structures
#### Contacts
Contacts are implemented as Redis JSON objects.  Each contact contains a JSON array of requisite skills.
#### Agents
Agents are implemented as Redis JSON objects.  Each agent has meta data (first and last names) and a JSON array of their skills.
#### Skills/Available Agents
Availability queues for each skill are implemented as Redis Sorted Sets.  The members of the set are available agents.  Their associated scores are a timestamp (ms) signifying when they became available.  This allows for LAA selection.
#### Queue
A universal queue is implemented as a Redis Sorted Set.  The members of the set are the keys to the contacts and their associated scores are timestamps of their entry time to queue.  This allows for multi-skill selection and FIFO handling.

### Agent Targeting
 - Available agents are placed into availability sorted sets per skill with a timestamp as their score.
 - Contacts are placed into queue implemented as a sorted set with a timestamp as their score.
 - Contacts are taken off of queue in a FIFO manner with BZPOPMIN
 - Agents are targeted via ZINTER of the skill availability sets.  The Agent with the lowest score (oldest timestamp) and possessing all the requisite skills for a contact gets selected.

### Load Balancing
HAProxy is used for load balancing all client connections.
#### High Availability
Two HAProxy instances are deployed in a HA configuration via keepalived (VRRP).  The VIP those instances share is 192.168.20.100.
#### Rest API Server Connections - Port 8000
- HTTP round-robin load balancing across 2 servers
- Dynamic scaling/Docker replica support via DNS and server-template
#### Redis Admin Console Connections - Port 8443
- HTTP least connection load balancing across 3 servers
- TLS back-to-back sessions.  A self-signed certificate is generated by the start.sh script.  That cert is used for the front-end.  The default Redis-generated cert is used on the back-end.
- 'Sticky' sessions via server cookie
#### Redis REST API Connections - Port 9443
- TCP round-robin load balancing across 3 servers
- TLS pass-thru
#### Redis Database Connections - Port 12000
- TCP round-robin load balancing across 3 servers
- Layer 7 health check via authenticated client connection w/Redis PING.
